# WayToAdopt
WayToAdopt is a web application for finding, adopting, or announcing homes for stray and homeless animals. My responsibility in this project is to be the full-stack developer for creating the header, showing information about selected animals, and creating a question form for starting the adoption process. In addition, I created a database for use in the project.

# Function Requirement
  1. Users can register and create a user account containing at least some information, including their first and last name (name), telephone number (phone number), email (email), and password (password).
  2. Users must log in before they can use the website.
  3. Users can log out of the website.
  4. The user can create announcements. To find homes for animals You can specify information about the animal you're looking for, such as type, breed, gender, date of birth, color, treatment received, personality traits, etc., and you can specify questions for checking readiness for adoption, such as type of residence and system for raising.
  5. Users can choose to adopt an animal on an ad that is still available. The user must first answer questions to check their readiness to adopt.
  6. Users who are looking for a home and users who want to adopt can communicate with each other.
  7. Users can search for and view detailed information about various announcements. The search criteria include the type of animal. Vaccination, sterilization, weaning, and use of litter boxes.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
